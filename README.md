# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

#Overview of the Analysis: 
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.



#Results: 

As expected the urban cities have the high number of rides and drivers of the three city types. Suburban cities are in second place and rural cities are last or third place. This is an expected result as most people living in cities do not have their own vehicles for transportation and rely more heavily public transportation, cabs and ride shares. Suburban cities also have more residents with their own vehicles and in rural cities having ones own form of transportation is usually essential as there is very limited public transportation, cabs or ride shares. 

There was also a trend in the amount of each fare being highest in the rural cities, followed by the suburban and lastly urban cities. This is also to be expected as urban cities are more densely populated, therefore most rides are a shorter distance. The further you move geographically away from the urban cities, the more spread out locations are and you must travel greater distances from point a to point b. If the rides fees are based on milage, which I expect they are, that explains the increase in fares for the more rural areas. 

Having basic information about the fares, city types, number of rides and drivers, etc we can drill down further to dates/date ranges to also view the most active times of the year for rides. The rides are more consistent in the urban cities, most likely due to the fact that people living in urban cities are more dependent upon public transportation and ride shares. There were some very slow months in the rural cities and also a bit slower in the suburban cities. The number of rides decreased. 


#Summary: 

Urban cities are the most profitable for ride shares and have the most consistent revenue stream for PyBer. It would make sense to continue investing in this sector. However, there could be expansion possibilities in the suburban and rural areas. It would be challenging to to gain ridership but perhaps a new marketing strategy could convince some people to leave their cars in the garage and take public transportation/ride shares instead.
